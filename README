System statistics scripts

1. Requirements
Install script:
    - awk
    - cut
    - sed
    - grep
    
Runtime:
    - RRDTool >= 1.2.0
    - ruby-gems
    - RubyRRDTool (via rubygems)


2. Preparations
2.1 FreeBSD
# cd /usr/ports/net/rubygem-rrdtool/ && make install distclean

2.2 Debian
# apt-get install ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev librrd2 librrd2-dev
# gem install RubyRRDtool -b


3. Installation
Use the install.sh script for installation. For further help
read the builtin help:

    ./install.sh -h

The script will create a RC/Init-script which can be copied
or linked to the proper directories or runlevels.
